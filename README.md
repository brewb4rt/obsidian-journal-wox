# obsidian-journal-wox
A little Python plugin for adding text to your Obsidian.md journal. 

## Setup
Just configure your specific folders in the lines 12, 13 and 14 of obsidian_wox.py and everything should work. This plugin just appends the querytext of wox to your journal file.
If you didn't create a file today, it will create an empty file and append the text.
